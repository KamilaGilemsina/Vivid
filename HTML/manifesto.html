    <!-- Manifesto Section 1 -->
    <section>
        <h1>manifesto</h1>
        
        <p>We are Vivid Squad.<br>
        We are not individuals; we are an idea.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Anonymity is our canvas</h2>
        <p>We believe that true creative freedom begins when the ego dissolves. By removing our individual identities, we create space for pure expression—unbound by reputation, expectations, or personal brand. Our work speaks, not our names.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Collective over individual</h2>
        <p>Great visions are built by many hands. We thrive on collaborative energy, where ideas are refined, challenged, and elevated through shared perspective. Every pixel is a conversation; every project, a consensus.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Art as dialogue</h2>
        <p>We don't create in a vacuum. Our work is an open invitation—to feel, to question, to reinterpret. We see digital spaces not as endpoints, but as living galleries where viewer and creation coexist and co-evolve.</p>

    <!-- Manifesto Section 2 -->
    <section>
        <h1>Embrace the glitch</h1>
        <p>Perfection is a limitation. We find beauty in the unexpected—the digital decay, the corrupted file, the algorithm's mistake. These "errors" are not failures; they are signatures of the medium itself.</p>
        
        <h2>Vividness as resistance</h2>
        <p>In an age of digital grayscale, we choose saturation. We believe in color as emotion, contrast as statement, and boldness as a form of quiet rebellion. To be vivid is to be unignorable.</p>
        
        <h2>No gatekeepers</h2>
        <p>Art belongs everywhere—not just in galleries or behind paywalls. We create for public spaces, both digital and physical. Our tools are open, our process is transparent, and our art is for anyone who feels it.</p>
