        <p>A living, breathing digital canvas where light, sound, and motion converge.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>NEON DREAMS is an immersive, real-time interactive experience that transforms the browser into a dynamic art space. Built as a fusion of generative visuals and responsive audio, the project invites visitors to shape their own ethereal environments through movement, clicks, and sound.</p>
        
        <p>Using the microphone and mouse as inputs, the installation responds to ambient noise, voice, and interaction-rendering pulsating waves, fluid particle systems, and neon-drenched landscapes that evolve with every engagement. The visuals are driven by custom GLSL shaders, creating hypnotic gradients, glitch effects, and organic light trails that feel almost alive.</p>
        
        <p>The experience is designed to be both meditative and playful, a digital sanctuary where technology meets emotion. It serves as a testament to the creative potential of real-time web graphics and audio reactivity, exploring how anonymity in creation can lead to universally personal moments of connection.</p>
        
        <p>Perfect for exhibitions, digital showcases, or as a standalone piece of net art, NEON DREAMS blurs the line between user and artist-every session is unique, every interaction tells a story.</p>
