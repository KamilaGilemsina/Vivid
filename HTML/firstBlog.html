        <p>In an era where every artist is a brand and every creator a persona, we choose the opposite path: <strong>anonymity as our medium</strong>.<br>
        We believe that identity can be a cage. A name, a face, a story—all become filters through which art is perceived.<br>
        Stripping this away isn't an act of hiding, but of liberation. Without an author to idolize or critique, the work must speak for itself.</p>

        <p>Anonymity is not an absence—it's a space. A blank canvas where ideas, not egos, collide.</p>
        
        <p>For us, this means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on the collective, not the individual</li>
            <li>Freedom to experiment without personal legacy</li>
            <li>Art as dialogue, not monologue</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When you don't know who made it, you're left with only one question: What does it make you feel?<br>
        That's where true connection begins.</p>
