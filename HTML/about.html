        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        
        <p>Vivid Squad is more than a name – it is a shared identity, a manifesto, and a creative signal sent from the shadows.</p>
        
        <p>We are an anonymous, decentralized collective of digital artists, designers, and visual architects connected across continents. Operating without individual faces, we channel our entire focus into the work itself: transforming conceptual boldness into striking visual experiences. Our practice spans from brand identities that tell silent stories to immersive digital art that bends perception, from motion design that pulses with intent to illustrations that speak without words.</p>
